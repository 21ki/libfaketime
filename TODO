Open issues / next steps for libfaketime development

- support interception of further system calls, e.g. clock_nanosleep (#105),
  walltime (#195), chrono::system_clock::now (#176), select (#115)

- fake timer_create and friends
- add more functional tests that check more than the basic functionality
- use the testing framework to also implement unit tests
- work around thread local storage issue, e.g., by using pthreads
- integrate manchicken's autoconf/automake support to get rid of separate Makefile.OSX
